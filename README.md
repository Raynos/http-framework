## Motivation

`require('http')` is a web framework. All you need are a few
  small modules that do one thing well when you are building your
  web application route handlers.

This module aggregates and documents (with examples) a selection
  of small modules that can be used to achieve this goal.

It's recommended you check out the:

  - [the wiki of modules][23]
  - [the documentation][22]
  - [the examples][21]

I do not recommend you use this "framework". You should check
  out the small modules and use them directly. Use the list of
  examples here for inspiration.

http-framework is an OPEN Open Source Project, see the Contributing 
  section to find out what this means.

## [Modules][20]

Check out the [modules folder](modules) for an example of small
  modules you can combine to build your own custom "framework"

See the [`package.json`][19] dependencies hash for an example of
  many small modules used in the examples folder of this project.
